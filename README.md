Now that we have an existing ticket, we will log in as Help Desk Agent (John). 
  
1. Select Tickets tab, where we can see open tickets.

2. Select the current open ticket.

Notice that there is an assigned ticket number and a subject line. Within the selected ticket, we can observe different properties, such as priority, department, SLA, and who it is assigned to. As John, we can choose a department. In this case, we are selecting the "Support" department. We will assign the ticket to the online banking team since the problem revolves around access to the online banking portal. Additionally, we can select a severity level, which requires the ticket to be resolved within a preconfigured time frame.

<h2>Resolving Tickets</h2>
<p>

We created a ticket, observed the properties, and assigned it. Now, we can work to resolve the issue, which requires problem-solving skills. John recalls that a recent update was processed by the company and suspects it may be causing the issue. He decides to troubleshoot by uninstalling the update. John finds that users can now access the online banking portal. John has resolved the ticket through critical thinking and troubleshooting. The final step is for John to post a concise explanation of what he did in the ticket thread. Once the comment is posted, John will go to the Ticket Status section and change the status to "Resolved." 
  
In this tutorial, we have successfully created a ticket, set its properties, and resolved it.
